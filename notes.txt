------------------------
REFACTOR / RESTRUCTURE
------------------------
    ✔ Move StatusBadge into UI
    ✔ No button tag should be in the <td> where not needed
    ✔ Make reusable component for No result, Loading, Not found, etc. messages
    ✔ Make getDurationWithColor scalable and able to choose as many intervals and colors as needed (+ integrate color style in JSX)
    ✔ Rename addCommentUnderStatus to addNewComment and addCommentToCollectionStatus to addComment


------------------------
FUNCTIONALITIES / UI / UX
------------------------
    ✔ System message if no match to filter options. The message is displayed only if no match to the search value
    ✔ A-Z & Z-A order in collection table
    ✔ Lorry spent time plus indicator displayed in the table row:
        ✔ time <= 1h ==> green
        ✔ 1h <= time < 2h ==> yellow
        ✔ time >= 2h ==> red 
    ✔ Add a "filter reset button" to set all filters back to default.
    ✔ Use setInterval to update the displayed times.
    ✔ For addCollection: in-progress, failed, success messages
    ✔ For status update: in-progress, failed, success messages
    ✔ Under the badge, display the spent time of that status.
    ✔ Delete collection: failed message and retry option on error.
    ✔ Simulate collection deleting error.
    - Authentication
    - Listen to server/database changes and update UI accordingly
    - In the info modal:
        - Option to edit records
        ✔ Don't display the show/hide comment icon while a comment is being added
        ✔ Hide the modal close button while a comment is being added
        ✔ Comment adding:
            ✔ In "progress/failed" messages should be displayed only at the currently edited comment form
            ✔ Clear error message when user starts typing again
            ✔ Clear error message when show/hide icons or Close button click
            ✔ Add Retry button if comment adding failed
    - What if the status just accidentally changed? How to redo it?
    - Authorization on login. userId: "9999", // This should come from auth state
    - (From-To date picker as filter?)


------------------------
STYLES
------------------------
    ✔ Make form element styles global
    - Design messages: progress/failed/success
    - Make status badge colors global => easy to scale/change
    - When adding comment in the info modal, disable concurrent fields/buttons
    - Dark mode in the settings
    - Fix the sidebar collapse on event when hamburger icon is clicked


------------------------
TO SETTINGS PAGE
------------------------
    - Today's collections checked by default or not
    - Dark mode / Bright mode / Device default
    - Do you want to get notifications if lorry spent time exceeds 1h, 2h...
    - Collection table default ordering
    - If browser refreshes, keep the currently selected filters
    - Collection table default ordering by time (newest/oldest first?)


------------------------
REPORTS
------------------------
    - Average & sum loading time of the day/week/month/year
    - AM vs PM metrics

------------------------

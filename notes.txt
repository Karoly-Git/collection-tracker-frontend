------------------------
REFACTOR / RESTRUCTURE
------------------------
    ✔ Move StatusBadge into UI
    ✔ No button tag should be in the <td> where not needed.
    ✔ Make reusable component for No result, Loading, Not found, etc. messages.
    ✔ getDurationWithColor: make it scalable and able to choose as many intervals and colors as needed (+ integrate color style in JSX)
    - Rename addCommentUnderStatus to addNewComment


------------------------
FUNCTIONALITIES / UI / UX
------------------------
    ✔ System message if no match to filter options. At this moment, the message is displayed only if no match to the searching value.
    ✔ A-Z & Z-A order in collection table
    ✔ Lorry spent time plus indicator displayed in the table row:
        ✔ - time <= 1h ==> green
        ✔ - 1h <= time < 2h ==> yellow
        ✔ - time >= 2h ==> red 
    ✔ Add a "filter reset button" to set all filters back to default.
    ✔ setInterval to update the displayed times.
    ✔ For addCollection: in-progress, failed, success messages
    ✔ For status update: in-progress, failed, success messages
    ✔ Under the badge, display the spent time of that status.
    ✔ Delete collection: failed message and retry option if error occurs.
    ✔ Symulate collection deleting error.
    - Authentication
    - Listening to server/database changes and update accordingly
    - In the info modal:
        - option to amend the records
        ✔ dont display the show/hide comment icon while a comment is being added
        ✔ hide the modal close button while a comment is being added
        ✔ Comment adding:
            ✔ "in progress/failed" messages should be displayed only at the currently edited comment form
            ✔ clear error message when user starts typing again
            ✔ clear error message when show/hide icons or close button clicked
            ✔ Add Retry button if comment adding failed

    - Authorisation on login. userId: "9999", // This should come from auth state
    - (From-To date picker as filter?)

------------------------
REFACTOR / RESTRUCTURE
------------------------
    ✔ Move StatusBadge into UI
    ✔ No button tag should be in the <td> where not needed.
    ✔ Make reusable component for No result, Loading, Not found, etc. messages.
    ✔ getDurationWithColor: make it scalable and able to choose as many intervals and colors as needed (+ integrate color style in JSX)
    - Authentication
    - Listening to server/database changes and update accordingly


------------------------
FUNCTIONALITIES / UI / UX
------------------------
    ✔ System message if no match to filter options. At this moment, the message is displayed only if no match to the searching value.
    ✔ A-Z & Z-A order in collection table
    ✔ Lorry spent time plus indicator displayed in the table row:
        ✔ / time <= 1h ==> green
        ✔ / 1h <= time < 2h ==> yellow
        ✔ / time >= 2h ==> red 
    ✔ Add a "filter reset button" to set all filters back to default.
    ✔ setInterval to update the displayed times.
    ✔ For addCollection: in-progress, failed, success messages
    ✔ For status update: in-progress, failed, success messages
    ✔ Under the badge, display the spent time of that status.
    - In the info modal:
        / option to amend the records
        ✔ dont display the show/hide comment icon while a comment is being added
        ✔ hide teh modal close button while a comment is being added
        / the "adding in progress/failed to add messages should be 
          displayed only at the currently edited comment form, not for all comments
    - What if the status just accidentally changed? How to redo it?
    - Authorisation on login. userId: "9999", // This should come from auth state
    - When adding comment in the info modal, disable concurrent fields/buttons
    - If browser refreshes, keep the currently selected filters.
    - (From-To date picker as filter?)
    - Delete collection: failed message handling

------------------------
REFACTOR / RESTRUCTURE
------------------------
    ✔ Move StatusBadge into UI
    ✔ No button tag should be in the <td> where not needed.
    ✔ Make reusable component for No result, Loading, Not found, etc. messages.
    - Authentication
    - Listening to server/database changes and update accordingly
    - getDurationWithColor: make it scalable to be able to choose as many intervals and colors as needed (integrate color style in JSX)
    - Make status badge colors global => easy to scale/change


------------------------
FUNCTIONALITIES / UI / UX
------------------------
    ✔ System message if no match to filter options. At this moment, the message is displayed only if no match to the searching value.
    ✔ A-Z & Z-A order in collection table
    - What if the status just accidentally changed? How to redo it?
    - Authorisation on login. userId: "9999", // This should come from auth state
    ✔ Lorry spent time plus indicator displayed in the table row:
        / time <= 1h ==> green
        / 1h <= time < 2h ==> yellow
        / time >= 2h ==> red 
    ✔ Add a "filter reset button" to set all filters back to default.
    - Under the badge, display the spent time of that status.
    - For status update: in-progress, failed SystemMessages
    - When adding comment in the info modal, disable concurrent fields/buttons
    - In the info modal: option to amend the records
    - If browser refreshes, keep the currently selected filters.
    - setInterval to update the displayed times.
    - (From-To date picker as filter?)


------------------------
STYLES
------------------------
    ✔ Make form element styles global
    - Dark mode in the settings
    - Fix the sidebar collapse on event when hamburger icon is clicked


------------------------
TO SETTINGS PAGE
